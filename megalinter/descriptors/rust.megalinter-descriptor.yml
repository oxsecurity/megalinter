      **clippy** is Rust's official linter that catches common mistakes and improves code quality through **750+ categorized lints**. It organizes lints into groups like **correctness** (code that's wrong), **performance** (optimization opportunities), **style** (idiomatic patterns), **complexity** (simplification suggestions), and **pedantic** (strict guidelines). Features include **automatic fixes** for many issues, **extensive configuration options**, **MSRV support** for older Rust versions, and **seamless Cargo integration**. Essential for maintaining high-quality, idiomatic Rust code and preventing common programming errors before they reach production.
