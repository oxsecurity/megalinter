[ERROR] .automation/test/snakemake/snakemake_bad_1.smk
    Lints for rule simulation (line 11, .automation/test/snakemake/snakemake_bad_1.smk):
        * No log directive defined:
          Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
          distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover.
          In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
          unreadable.

        * Specify a conda environment or container for each rule.:
          This way, the used software for each specific step is documented, and the
          workflow can be executed on any machine without prerequisites.
