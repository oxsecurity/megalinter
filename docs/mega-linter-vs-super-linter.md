# MegaLinter vs Super-Linter

The hard-fork of Super-Linter to be rewritten in Python isn't just a language switch: use of python flexibility and libraries allowed to define lots of additional functions described below

## Security

MegaLinter [hides many environment variables](config-variables-security.md) when calling the linters.

That way you need to trust only MegaLinter core code with your secrets, not the 100+ embedded linters !

## Performances

- [MegaLinter Flavors](flavors.md) allow to use **smaller docker images**, so the pull time is reduced
- Thanks to python multiprocessing capabilities, **linters are run in parallel**, which is way faster than Super-Linter bash script who runs all linters in sequence
- When the linter allows it, call it **1 time with N files**, instead of calling **N times with one file**

## More languages and formats linted

- **C**, **C++**, **Copy-Paste detection**, **Credentials**, **GraphQL**, **JSON & YAML with JSON schemas**, **Markdown tables formatting**, **Puppet**, **reStructuredText**, **Rust**, **Scala**, **Spell checker**, **Swift**, **Visual Basic .NET** …

## Automatically apply formatting and fixes

MegaLinter can [**automatically apply fixes performed by linters**](config-apply-fixes.md), and **push them to the same branch**, or **create a Pull Request** that you can validate

This is pretty handy, especially for linter errors related to formatting (in that case, you don't have any manual update to perform)

## Run locally

MegaLinter can be run locally thanks to [mega-linter-runner](https://megalinter.io/mega-linter-runner/)

## Reports

### Capabilities

- Accuracy: Count the total number of errors and not only the number of files in error
- Show linter version and applied filters for each linter processed
- Reports stored as artefacts on GitHub Action run or other remote files
  - General log
  - One report file by linter

### Additional Reporters

## Enhanced Configuration

- **Assisted installation and configuration** using a yeoman generator and JSON schemas for configuration file

![Runner Install](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/docs/assets/images/mega-linter-runner-generator.gif?raw=true)

![Assisted configuration](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/assisted-configuration.gif)

- Configure **include and exclude regexes** for a **single language or linter**: ex: `JAVASCRIPT_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE (src)`
- Configure **additional CLI arguments** for a linter: ex: `JAVASCRIPT_ES_ARGUMENTS "--debug --env-info"`
- Configure **non blocking errors** for a **single language or linter**: ex: `JAVASCRIPT_DISABLE_ERRORS`
- **Simplify languages and linters variables**
  - ENABLE = list of languages and formats to apply lint on codebase (default: all)
  - ENABLE_LINTERS = list of linters to apply lint on codebase (default: all)
  - DISABLE = list of languages and formats to skip (default: none)
  - DISABLE_LINTERS = list of linters to skip (default: none)
  - Variables VALIDATE_XXX are still taken in account (but should not be used in association with ENABLE and DISABLE variables)

## Enhanced Documentation

- [**HTML documentation**](https://megalinter.io/)

![HTML doc home](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/html_doc_home.jpg)

- **One page per linter documentation** :
  - **All variables** that can be used with this linter
  - List of **file extensions, names and filters** applied by the linter
  - Link to **MegaLinter default linter configuration**
  - Link to linter Web-Site
  - Link to official page explaining **how to customize the linter rules**
  - Link to official page explaining **how to disable rules from source comments**
  - **Examples** of linter command line calls behind the hood
  - **Help** command text
  - Installation commands

- Installation links for related IDEs

![HTML doc IDE](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/html_doc_ide.jpg)

- README
  - Separate languages, formats and tooling formats in the linters table
  - Add logos for each descriptor

## Plugins management

For linters less commonly used, MegaLinters offers a plugins architecture so anyone can publish plugins

## Simplify architecture and evolutive maintenance

- Refactoring runtime in Python, for easier handling than bash thanks to [classes](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter) and python modules
- Everything related to each linter [in a single descriptor YML file](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter/descriptors)
  - easier evolutive maintenance
  - less conflicts to manage between PRs.
  - Few special cases require a [python linter class](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter/descriptors))
- [Default behaviours for all linters](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/megalinter/Linter.py), with possibility to override part of them for special cases
- Hierarchical architecture: Apply fixes and new behaviours to all linters with a single code update
- **Documentation as code**
  - Generate linters tables (ordered by type: language, format & tooling format) and include it in README. [(see result)](https://megalinter.io/supported-linters/)
  - Generate one markdown file per Linter, containing all configuration variables, infos and examples [(See examples)](https://megalinter.io/descriptors/javascript_eslint/)
- **Automatic generation of Dockerfile** using YML descriptors, always using the linter latest version
  - Dockerfile commands (FROM, ARG, ENV, COPY, RUN )
  - APK packages (linux)
  - NPM packages (node)
  - PIP packages (python)
  - GEM packages (ruby)
  - Phive packages (PHP)
- Have a centralized exclude list (node_modules,.rbenv, etc…)

## Improve robustness & stability

- [Test classes](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/megalinter/tests/test_megalinter) for each capability
- [Test classes for each linter](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter/tests/test_megalinter/linters): Automatic generation of test classes using [.automation/build.py](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/.automation/build.py)
- Setup **code coverage** [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/oxsecurity/megalinter/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/oxsecurity/megalinter)
- **Development CD / CI**
  - Validate multi-status on PR inside each PR (posted from step "Run against all code base")
  - Run test classes and code coverage with pytest during validation GitHub Action
  - Validate descriptor YML files with json schema during build
  - Automated job to upgrade linters to their latest stable version
