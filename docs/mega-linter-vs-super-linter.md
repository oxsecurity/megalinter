# MegaLinter vs Super-Linter

The hard fork of Super-Linter to Python isn't just a language switch: Python's flexibility and libraries enabled many additional features described below.

## Security

MegaLinter [hides many environment variables](config-variables-security.md) when calling the linters.

That way you need to trust only MegaLinter core code with your secrets, not the 100+ embedded linters !

## Performance

- [MegaLinter flavors](flavors.md) allow using smaller Docker images, reducing pull time.
- Thanks to Python multiprocessing, linters are run in parallel, which is much faster than Super-Linter's Bash script that runs all linters sequentially.
- When the linter allows it, call it once with N files, instead of calling it N times with one file.

## More languages and formats linted

- **C**, **C++**, **Copy-Paste detection**, **Credentials**, **GraphQL**, **JSON & YAML with JSON schemas**, **Markdown tables formatting**, **Puppet**, **reStructuredText**, **Rust**, **Scala**, **Spell checker**, **Swift**, **Visual Basic .NET** …

## Automatically apply formatting and fixes

MegaLinter can [automatically apply fixes performed by linters](config-apply-fixes.md) and push them to the same branch, or create a Pull Request that you can validate.

This is pretty handy, especially for linter errors related to formatting (in that case, you don't have any manual update to perform)

## Run locally

MegaLinter can be run locally thanks to [mega-linter-runner](https://megalinter.io/mega-linter-runner/).

## Reports

### Capabilities

- Accuracy: Count the total number of errors, not only the number of files in error.
- Show linter version and applied filters for each linter processed.
- Reports stored as artifacts on GitHub Actions runs or other remote files
  - General log
  - One report file by linter

## Enhanced configuration

- Assisted installation and configuration using a Yeoman generator and JSON schemas for the configuration file

![Assisted configuration](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/assisted-configuration.gif)

- Configure include and exclude regexes for a single language or linter: e.g., `JAVASCRIPT_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE (src)`
- Configure additional CLI arguments for a linter: e.g., `JAVASCRIPT_ES_ARGUMENTS "--debug --env-info"`
- Configure non-blocking errors for a single language or linter: e.g., `JAVASCRIPT_DISABLE_ERRORS`
- Simplified languages and linters variables
  - ENABLE = list of languages and formats to apply lint on codebase (default: all)
  - ENABLE_LINTERS = list of linters to apply lint on codebase (default: all)
  - DISABLE = list of languages and formats to skip (default: none)
  - DISABLE_LINTERS = list of linters to skip (default: none)
  - Variables VALIDATE_XXX are still taken in account (but should not be used in association with ENABLE and DISABLE variables)

## Enhanced documentation

- [HTML documentation](https://megalinter.io/)

![HTML doc home](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/html_doc_home.jpg)

- One page per linter documentation:
  - **All variables** that can be used with this linter
  - List of **file extensions, names and filters** applied by the linter
  - Link to MegaLinter default linter configuration
  - Link to linter website
  - Link to official page explaining **how to customize the linter rules**
  - Link to official page explaining **how to disable rules from source comments**
  - **Examples** of linter command line calls behind the hood
  - Help command text
  - Installation commands

- Installation links for related IDEs

![HTML doc IDE](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/raw/main/docs/assets/images/html_doc_ide.jpg)

- README
  - Separate languages, formats, and tooling formats in the linters table
  - Add logos for each descriptor

## Plugin management

For less commonly used linters, MegaLinter offers a plugin architecture so anyone can publish plugins.

## Simplify architecture and evolutionary maintenance

- Refactoring runtime in Python, for easier handling than Bash thanks to [classes](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter) and Python modules
- Everything related to each linter is in a [single descriptor YAML file](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter/descriptors)
  - Easier ongoing maintenance
  - Fewer conflicts to manage between PRs
  - A few special cases require a [Python linter class](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/tree/main/megalinter/descriptors))
- [Default behaviors for all linters](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/megalinter/Linter.py), with the possibility to override parts of them for special cases
- Hierarchical architecture: Apply fixes and new behaviors to all linters with a single code update
- Documentation as code
  - Generate linters tables (ordered by type: language, format, and tooling format) and include them in the README. [(see result)](https://megalinter.io/supported-linters/)
  - Generate one markdown file per linter, containing all configuration variables, information, and examples [(see examples)](https://megalinter.io/descriptors/javascript_eslint/)
- Automatic generation of Dockerfiles using YAML descriptors, always using the linter's latest version
  - Dockerfile commands (FROM, ARG, ENV, COPY, RUN)
  - APK packages (Linux)
  - NPM packages (Node.js)
  - PIP packages (Python)
  - GEM packages (Ruby)
  - Phive packages (PHP)
- Have a centralized exclude list (node_modules, .rbenv, etc.)

## Improve robustness & stability

- Test classes for each capability
- Test classes for each linter: automatic generation of test classes using [.automation/build.py](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/.automation/build.py)
- Set up code coverage [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/oxsecurity/megalinter/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/oxsecurity/megalinter)
- Development CI/CD
  - Validate multi-status on PR inside each PR (posted from step "Run against all code base")
  - Run test classes and code coverage with pytest during validation GitHub Action
  - Validate descriptor YML files with json schema during build
  - Automated job to upgrade linters to their latest stable version
