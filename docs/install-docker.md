# Docker container

You can also run MegaLinter with its Docker container. Execute this command:

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw -v $(pwd):/tmp/lint:rw oxsecurity/megalinter:v9`

No extra arguments are needed; however, MegaLinter will lint all files inside the `/tmp/lint` folder. You may need to configure your tool of choice to use `/tmp/lint` as its workspace.
This can be changed:

_Example:_

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw -v $(pwd):/example/folder:rw oxsecurity/megalinter:v9`
