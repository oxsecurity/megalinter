# Docker container

You can also run megalinter with its Docker container, just execute this command:

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw -v $(pwd):/tmp/lint:rw oxsecurity/megalinter:v7`

**No extra arguments are needed,** however, megalinter will lint all of the files inside the `/tmp/lint` folder, so it may be needed to configure your tool of choice to use the `/tmp/lint` folder as workspace.
This can also be changed:

_Example:_

`docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw -v $(pwd):/example/folder:rw oxsecurity/megalinter:v7`
