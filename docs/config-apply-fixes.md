# Apply fixes

Mega-linter is able to apply fixes provided by linters. To use this capability, you need 3 **env variables** defined at top level

- **APPLY_FIXES**: `all` to apply fixes of all linters, or a list of linter keys (ex: `JAVASCRIPT_ES`,`MARKDOWN_MARKDOWNLINT`)

Only for GitHub Action Workflow file if you use it:

- **APPLY_FIXES_EVENT**: `all`, `push`, `pull_request`, `none` _(use none in case of use of [Updated sources reporter](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md))_
- **APPLY_FIXES_MODE**: `commit` to create a new commit and push it on the same branch, or `pull_request` to create a new PR targeting the branch.

## Apply fixes issues

You may see **github permission errors**, or workflows not run on the new commit.

To solve these issues, you can apply one of the following solutions.

- Method 1: The most secured
  - [Create Fine Grained Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token), scoped only on your repository and then copy the PAT value
  - [Define environment secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment) named **PAT** on your repository, and paste the PAT value
  - Update your Github Actions Workflow to add the environment name

- Method 2: Easier, but any contributor with write access can see your Personal Access Token
  - [Create Classic Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token), then copy the PAT value
  - [Define secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named **PAT** on your repository, and paste the PAT value

## Notes

- You can use [**Updated sources reporter**](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md) if you don't want fixes to be automatically applied on git branch, but **download them in a zipped file** and manually **extract them in your project**
- If used, **APPLY_FIXES_EVENT** and **APPLY_FIXES_MODE** can not be defined in `.mega-linter.yml`config file, they must be set as environment variables
- If you use **APPLY_FIXES**, add the following line in your `.gitignore file`

```shell
megalinter-reports/
```
