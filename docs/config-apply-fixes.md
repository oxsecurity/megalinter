# Apply fixes

MegaLinter can apply fixes provided by linters. To use this capability, you need three environment variables defined at the top level.

- **APPLY_FIXES**: `all` to apply fixes of all linters, or a list of linter keys (ex: `JAVASCRIPT_ES`,`MARKDOWN_MARKDOWNLINT`)

Only for the GitHub Actions workflow file, if you use it:

- **APPLY_FIXES_EVENT**: `all`, `push`, `pull_request`, `none` _(use none in case of use of [Updated sources reporter](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md))_
- **APPLY_FIXES_MODE**: `commit` to create a new commit and push it on the same branch, or `pull_request` to create a new PR targeting the branch.

## Apply fixes issues

You may see GitHub permission errors, or workflows not running on the new commit.

To solve these issues, apply one of the following solutions.

- Method 1: The most secured
  - [Create a Fine-Grained Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token), scoped only to your repository and with **Contents: Read/Write**, then copy the PAT value
  - [Define environment secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment) named **PAT** on your repository, and paste the PAT value
  - Update your GitHub Actions workflow to add the environment name

-- Method 2: Easier, but any contributor with write access can see your Personal Access Token, so use it only on private repositories.
- [Create a Classic Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token), then copy the PAT value
- [Define secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named **PAT** on your repository, and paste the PAT value

## Notes

- You can use the [Updated sources reporter](reporters/UpdatedSourcesReporter.md) if you don't want fixes to be automatically applied on the Git branch. Instead, download them in a ZIP file and manually extract them into your project.
- If used, `APPLY_FIXES_EVENT` and `APPLY_FIXES_MODE` cannot be defined in the `.mega-linter.yml` config file; they must be set as environment variables.
- If you use `APPLY_FIXES`, add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```shell
megalinter-reports/
```
