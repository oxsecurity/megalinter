# Environment variables security

MegaLinter runs on a docker image and calls the linters via command line to gather their results.

If you run it from your **CI/CD pipelines**, the docker image may have **access to your environment variables, that can contain secrets** defined in CI/CD variables.

As it can be complicated to **trust** the authors of all the open-source linters, **MegaLinter removes variables from the environment used to call linters**.

Thanks to this feature, you only need to [**trust MegaLinter and its internal python dependencies**](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/megalinter/setup.py), but there is **no need to trust all the linters that are used** !

You can add secured variables to the default list using configuration property **SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES** in .mega-linter.yml or in an environment variable (priority is given to ENV variables above `.mega-linter.yml` property).

SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES_DEFAULT contains:

- GITHUB_TOKEN
- PAT
- SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN
- GIT_AUTHORIZATION_BEARER
- CI_JOB_TOKEN
- GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_MEGALINTER
- GITLAB_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE
- WEBHOOK_REPORTER_BEARER_TOKEN
- NPM_TOKEN
- DOCKER_USERNAME
- DOCKER_PASSWORD
- CODECOV_TOKEN
- GCR_USERNAME
- GCR_PASSWORD
- SMTP_PASSWORD

Example of adding extra secured variables `.mega-linter.yml`:

```yaml
SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES:
  - MY_SECRET_TOKEN
  - ANOTHER_VAR_CONTAINING_SENSITIVE_DATA
  - OX_API_KEY
```

Example of adding extra secured variables in CI variables, so they can not be overridden in .mega-linter.yml:

```shell
SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES=MY_SECRET_TOKEN,ANOTHER_VAR_CONTAINING_SENSITIVE_DATA,OX_API_KEY
```

Notes:

- If you override SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES_DEFAULT, it replaces the default list, so it's better to only define SECURED_ENV_VARIABLES to add them to the default list !
- Environment variables are secured for each command line called (linters, plugins, sarif formatter...) except for [PRE_COMMANDS](#pre-commands) , as you might need secured values within their code.
