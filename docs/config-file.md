# .mega-linter.yml file

MegaLinter configuration variables are defined in a **.mega-linter.yml** file at the root of the repository or with **environment variables**.
You can see an example config file in this repo: [**.mega-linter.yml**](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/.mega-linter.yml).

Configuration is assisted with autocompletion and validation in most commonly used IDEs, thanks to the [JSON schema](https://megalinter.io/json-schemas/configuration.html) stored on [schemastore.org](https://www.schemastore.org/).

- VS Code: You need an extension like [Red Hat YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).
- IntelliJ IDEA family: Autocompletion is supported natively.

You can also define variables as environment variables.
- If a variable exists in both ENV and the `.mega-linter.yml` file, priority is given to the ENV variable.
