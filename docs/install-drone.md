# Drone CI

**Warning: Drone CI support is experimental and is undergoing heavy modifications (see issue [#2047](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/issues/2047)).**

1. Create a `.drone.yml` file on the root directory of your repository

2. Copy and paste the following template:

```yaml
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: MegaLinter

workspace:
  path: /tmp/lint

steps:

- name: megalinter
  image: oxsecurity/megalinter:v8
  environment:
    DEFAULT_WORKSPACE: /tmp/lint
```

This uses the [Drone CI docker runner](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/docker/overview/), so it's needed to install and configure it beforehand on your Drone CI server.

## (Optional) Adjusting trigger rules

The Drone CI workflow should trigger automatically for every scenario (push, pull request, syncâ€¦) however, you can _optionally_ change this behavior by changing the trigger. For example:

```yaml
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: MegaLinter

workspace:
  path: /tmp/lint

steps:

- name: megalinter
  image: oxsecurity/megalinter:v8
  environment:
    DEFAULT_WORKSPACE: /tmp/lint

trigger:
  event:
  - push
```

The workflow above should only trigger on push, not on any other situation. For more information about how to configure Drone CI trigger rules, [click here](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/triggers/).
