# Quick Start

- Run `npx mega-linter-runner --install` to generate configuration files (you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed)
- Commit, push, and create a pull request
- Watch !

![Runner Install](https://github.com/oxsecurity/megalinter/blob/main/docs/assets/images/mega-linter-runner-generator.gif?raw=true)

**Notes**:

- This repo is a hard-fork of [GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter), rewritten in python to add [lots of additional features](mega-linter-vs-super-linter.md)
- If you are a Super-Linter user, you can transparently **switch to MegaLinter and keep the same configuration** (just replace `super-linter/super-linter@v3` by `oxsecurity/megalinter@v8` in your GitHub Action YML file, [like on this PR](https://github.com/nvuillam/npm-groovy-lint/pull/109))
- If you want to use MegaLinter extra features (recommended), please take 5 minutes to use [MegaLinter assisted installation](install-assisted.md)
