# Frequently Asked Questions

> My repo CI already have linters and they're perfectly working, so why do I need MegaLinter ?

You can perfectly **continue using your installed linters** and deactivate them in `.mega-linter.yml`. For example, in a javascript project using eslint, you can configure MegaLinter with `DISABLE: JAVASCRIPT`. That way, you will benefit from both your installed linters but also from other MegaLinter linters checking JSON, YAML, Markdown, Dockerfile, Bash, spelling mistakes, dead URLs…

> Ok but… how does it work ?

MegaLinter is based on Docker images containing either all linters, or just a selection of linters if you are using a MegaLinter flavor for a project using a specific language / format

The core architecture does the following:

- **Initialization**
  - **List all project files**:
    - except files in ignored folders (`node_modules`, etc…)
    - except files not matching `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` (if defined by user)
    - except files matching `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE` (if defined by user)
  - **Collect files for each activated linter**, matching their **own filtering criteria**:
    - file extensions
    - file names
    - file content
    - `<descriptor_or_linter_key>_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` (if defined by user)
    - `<descriptor_or_linter_key>_FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE` (if defined by user)
- **Linting**
  - **Parallelly**, for **each linter** with matching files:
    - **Call the linter** on matching files (or the whole project for some linters like copy-paste detector)
    - Call activated **linter-level reporters** (GitHub Status Reporter…)
- **Finalization**
  - Call activated **global level reporters** (GitHub Pull Request Comment Reporter, File.io Reporter, Email Reporter…)
  - Manage return code:
    - **0** if no error (or only non blocking errors if user defined `DISABLE_ERRORS` or `<descriptor_or_linter_key>_DISABLE_ERRORS`)
    - **1** if errors
