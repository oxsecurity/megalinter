# CLI lint mode

Each linter is pre-configured to use a default lint mode, which are visible in the MegaLinter documentation ([example](https://megalinter.io/latest/descriptors/repository_trivy/#how-the-linting-is-performed)). The possible values are:

- `list_of_files`: The linter is called only once, and passed a list of all the files to be processed
- `project`: The linter is called only once, from the root folder of the repository, and it scans for the files to process, as no file names are provided it
- `file`: The linter is called once per file, which hurts performance

You can override the CLI_LINT_MODE by using a configuration variable for each linter (see [linters documentation](https://megalinter.io/supported-linters/)).

- Linters that default to the `file` lint mode cannot be overridden to use the `list_of_files` lint mode
- Linters that default to the `project` lint mode cannot be overridden to use either the `list_of_files` or `file` lint modes.

Allowing `file` or `list_of_files` to be overridden to `project` is mostly for workarounds. For example, some linters have a problem finding their config file when the current folder isn't the repository's root folder.

Special considerations:

- Linters that are configured to use the `project` lint mode ignore variables like `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` and `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE`, as they are not passed a list of files to lint. For those linters, you must check their documentation to see if a linter can be configured to ignore specific files. For example, the [Secretlint](https://megalinter.io/latest/descriptors/repository_secretlint/) linter ignore files listed in `~/.secretlintignore` by default, or it can be configured to instead ignore files listed in `~/.gitignore` by setting `REPOSITORY_SECRETLINT_ARGUMENTS` to `--secretlintignore .gitignore.`.
