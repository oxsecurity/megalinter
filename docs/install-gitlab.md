```yaml

Create a Gitlab access token and define it in a variable **GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_MEGALINTER** in the project CI/CD masked variables. Make sure your token (e.g. if a project token) as the appropriate [role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) for commenting a merge request (at least developer).
