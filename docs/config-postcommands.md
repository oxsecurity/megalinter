# Post-commands

MegaLinter can run custom commands after running linters (for example, running additional tests)

Example in `.mega-linter.yml` config file

```yaml
POST_COMMANDS:
  - command: npm run test
    cwd: "workspace"   # Will be run at the root of the workspace (usually your repository root)
    continue_if_failed: False  # Will stop the process if command is failed (return code > 0)
```
