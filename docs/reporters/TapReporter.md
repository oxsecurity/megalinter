# TAP Reporter

Posts a pack of TAP logs , zipped as a GitHub Action artifact

- A separate TAP file for each processed linter

**Warning**: When TAP_REPORTER is `true`:

- Performances: all linters with CLI lint mode `list_of_files` are switched to `file` mode, so linter is called ont time per file to analyze
- Scope: all linters with CLI lint mode `project` are deactivated

For those reasonsâ€¦ why not having a look at [SARIF reporter](https://megalinter.io/latest/reporters/SarifReporter/), that doesn't have those issues ?

## Usage

Access GitHub action run
