# Gitlab Comment Reporter

Posts MegaLinter results summary in the comments of the related Gitlab merge request (if existing)

## Usage

Click on hyperlinks to access detailed logs (click on **Download** in **Artifacts section** at the left of a CI job page)

After a first MegaLinter run, a comment is posted on the MR. To avoid multiplicating MegaLinter MR comments, future MegaLinter runs will update the existing MR comment instead of posting a new one.

If you really want a new MR comment for each MegaLinter run, define variable `GITLAB_COMMENT_REPORTER_OVERWRITE_COMMENT` to `false`.

## Configuration

- Create an [access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token) with scope **api**
- Paste the access token in a [masked CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project) named **GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_MEGALINTER** in your project (repository)
