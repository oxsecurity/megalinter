# SARIF Reporter (beta)

Generates a full execution log in SARIF format within a file named **mega-linter-report.sarif** , located in report folder.

Note: Only linters able to handle SARIF will provide output in the aggregated SARIF file.

This reporter **is deactivated by default**.

## Usage

Activate the reporter (`SARIF_REPORTER: true`) to generate JSON report file.

If you want GitHub to handle the SARIF file to display it in its UI, add the following step in your GitHub Action Workflow.

```yaml
- name: Upload MegaLinter scan results to GitHub Security tab
if: success() || failure()
uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
with:
    sarif_file: 'megalinter-reports/megalinter-report.sarif'
```
