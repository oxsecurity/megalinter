- Version: **0.25.4**

## Configuration

### terragrunt configuration

- [Configure terragrunt rules](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/configuration/#terragrunt-configuration-file)
- terragrunt has no known capability to inline-disable rules

### Mega-linter configuration

- Enable terragrunt by adding `TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT` in [ENABLE_LINTERS variable](../index.md#activation-and-deactivation)
- Disable terragrunt by adding `TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT` in [DISABLE_LINTERS variable](../index.md#activation-and-deactivation)

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_ARGUMENTS | User custom arguments to add in linter CLI call<br/>Ex: `-s --foo "bar"` |  |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE | Custom regex including filter<br/>Ex: `\/(src\|lib)\/` | Include every file |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE | Custom regex excluding filter<br/>Ex: `\/(test\|examples)\/` | Exclude no file |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_FILE_NAME | terragrunt configuration file name</br>Use `LINTER_DEFAULT` to let the linter find it | `terragrunt.hcl` |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_RULES_PATH | Path where to find linter configuration file | Workspace folder, then Mega-Linter default rules |
| TERRAFORM_TERRAGRUNT_DISABLE_ERRORS | Run linter but disable crash if errors found | `false` |

## Behind the scenes

### How are identified applicable files

- File extensions:
  - `.hcl`


### Example calls

```shell
terragrunt hclfmt --terragrunt-check --terragrunt-hclfmt-file myfile.hcl
```

```shell
terragrunt hclfmt --terragrunt-check --terragrunt-config terragrunt.hcl --terragrunt-hclfmt-file myfile.hcl
```

DESCRIPTION:
   terragrunt - Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple
   Terraform modules, remote state, and locking. For documentation, see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/.

USAGE:
   terragrunt <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
   plan-all             Display the plans of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt plan' in each subfolder
   apply-all            Apply a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt apply' in each subfolder
   output-all           Display the outputs of a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt output' in each subfolder
   destroy-all          Destroy a 'stack' by running 'terragrunt destroy' in each subfolder
   validate-all         Validate 'stack' by running 'terragrunt validate' in each subfolder
   terragrunt-info      Emits limited terragrunt state on stdout and exits
   graph-dependencies   Prints the terragrunt dependency graph to stdout
   hclfmt               Recursively find terragrunt.hcl files and rewrite them into a canonical format.
   aws-provider-patch   Overwrite settings on nested AWS providers to work around a Terraform bug (issue #13018)
   *                    Terragrunt forwards all other commands directly to Terraform

   terragrunt-no-auto-init                      Don't automatically run 'terraform init' during other terragrunt commands. You must run 'terragrunt init' manually.

   terragrunt-working-dir                       The path to the Terraform templates. Default is current directory.
   terragrunt-download-dir                      The path where to download Terraform code. Default is .terragrunt-cache in the working directory.
   terragrunt-source                            Download Terraform configurations from the specified source into a temporary folder, and run Terraform in that temporary folder.
   terragrunt-source-update                     Delete the contents of the temporary folder to clear out any old, cached source code before downloading new source code into it.
   terragrunt-iam-role                          Assume the specified IAM role before executing Terraform. Can also be set via the TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE environment variable.
   terragrunt-ignore-dependency-errors          *-all commands continue processing components even if a dependency fails.
   terragrunt-ignore-dependency-order           *-all commands will be run disregarding the dependencies
   terragrunt-ignore-external-dependencies      *-all commands will not attempt to include external dependencies
   terragrunt-include-external-dependencies     *-all commands will include external dependencies
