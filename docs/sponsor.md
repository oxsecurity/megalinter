# Sponsoring

I maintain MegaLinter as a hobby, but when I'm not working on my [job as CTO at Cloudity](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-vuillamy/), I also have other hobbys like tasting good beers :)

So if you like MegaLinter and want to support me with one or several beers a month, please have a look a my [Github Sponsoring Page](https://github.com/sponsors/nvuillam)
