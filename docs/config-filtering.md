# Filter linted files

If you need to lint only a folder or exclude some files from linting, you can use optional environment parameters `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` and `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE`
You can apply filters to a single linter by defining variable `<LINTER_KEY>_FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE` and `<LINTER_KEY>_FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE`

Examples:

- Lint only src folder: `FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE: (src/)`
- Don't lint files inside test and example folders: `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE: (test/|examples/)`
- Don't lint javascript files inside test folder: `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE: (test/.*\.js)`

Warning: not applicable with linters using CLI lint mode `project` ([see details](config-cli-lint-mode.md))
